Code Refactor
In order for the webpage given by my client to meet accessibility standards, I made some neccessary improvement for the codebase without changing what it does.

    1. Capitalize the title of the page "Website"
    
    2. Adjust <a href> link so that the Search Engine Optimization bar is clickable

    3. Change <div></div> tag to <nav></nav> tag for nevigation bar

    4. Add alt="" attributes for six images 

    5. Change <div></div> tag to <footer></footer> tag for footer part

    6. After all, application's CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.
